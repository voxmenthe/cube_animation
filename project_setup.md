Requirements: Develop a web application using TypeScript, with support for Three.js and p5.js libraries, built and served using Vite.

Plan:
1. Analyze the package.json file
2. Review the tsconfig.json file
3. Examine the vite.config.ts file
4. Summarize the tech stack

Tech Stack Summary:

1. Core Language:
   - TypeScript (^5.5.4)

2. Frontend Libraries:
   - Three.js (^0.168.0) - 3D graphics library
   - p5.js (^1.10.0) - Creative coding library

3. Build and Development Tools:
   - Vite (^5.4.2) - Build tool and development server
   - ts-node (^10.9.2) - TypeScript execution environment
   - ts-node-dev (^2.0.0) - TypeScript development server with hot reloading

4. Configuration:
   - TypeScript is configured to target ES6 and use CommonJS modules
   - Strict mode is enabled for TypeScript
   - Vite is configured to use the 'src' directory as the root and output to 'dist'

5. Additional Tools:
   - @vitejs/plugin-react (^4.3.1) - Although not explicitly used in the current configuration, this suggests potential React integration

This project appears to be set up for developing a TypeScript-based web application with 3D graphics and creative coding capabilities, using modern build tools for efficient development and production builds.

History:
- Analyzed package.json, tsconfig.json, and vite.config.ts files
- Summarized the tech stack including core language, frontend libraries, build tools, and configuration details

Source Tree:
```

├── tsconfig.json

└── dist/
```

Next Task:
Consider creating an entry point for the application, such as `src/index.ts` or `src/main.ts`, to start building the project structure. Also, you might want to set up a basic HTML file to serve as the entry point for the Vite application.

EXPERT SPECIALIST suggestions:
1. Update the Vite configuration to use TypeScript directly, removing the need for ts-node in development.
2. Consider adding ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting consistency.
3. Set up a basic project structure with separate directories for components, utilities, and assets.
4. Create type definitions for any custom structures or modules you plan to use in the project.
